In order ensure greater professionalism among promoters, bring a certain level of consistency in the practices of promoters, enforcement of code of conduct and to discourage fraudulent promoters, the practice of registering Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO) in the real estate sector in Maharashtra was introduced through MahaRERA Order No. 10 (No. MahaRERA /Secy/Order /1003/2019, dated 11.10.2019). In Order No. 10, the eligibility Criteria prescribed was that the proposed SRO should have at least 500 MahaRERA registered project of their members. From the available data of registered projects with MahaRERA, it is noticed that there is a difference in development activities undertaken in Mumbai Metropolitan Region area and in the rest of Maharashtra. Considering this difference some SROs working outside Mumbai Metropolitan Region have requested that the criteria of having 500 MahaRERA registered projects of their members be reduced. In order to facilitate and promote the real estate sector and considering the difference in development activities in Mumbai Metropolitan Region area and in the rest of Maharashtra, MahaRERA has decided to amend MahaRERA Order No. 10 as under 1. Clause (1) b of MahaRERA Order No. 10 shall be substituted by following Clause (1) b. “७. The Proposed SRO should have (i) at least 500 MahaRERA registered projects of their members if the SRO has some or all members from Mumbai Metropolitan Region.
