This approach supports preventing defects from arising initially, thereby obviating the need for costly rework. By ensuring rigorous standards of material quality and workmanship throughout the construction process, real estate projects can be executedwith a defect-free outcome that adheres to strict quality standards.

It highlights the importance of quality assurance as a preemptive measure rather than just a reactive one, ultimately bolstering the trust and confidence of homebuyers in the real estate market.
